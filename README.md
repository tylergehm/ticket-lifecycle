<h1>osTicket in Action: End-to-End Ticket Management and Helpdesk Workflow Simulation</h1>
This project extends the osTicket environment to simulate real-world helpdesk operations by having end-users submit tickets via the public portal while agents and administrators interact through the agent and admin panels. Department hierarchies are adjusted to control ticket visibility, and tickets are created, observed, prioritized, assigned to appropriate SLAs, departments, and teams, then resolved according to role-based permissions. Access restrictions are tested by reassigning high-severity tickets to restricted departments, demonstrating how visibility and edit rights are enforced. The project highlights ticketing system email integration for automatic user updates and emphasizes best practices in incident intake—stressing that all support interactions, regardless of source (phone, chat, email, web, or in-person), should be documented as tickets to ensure accountability, accurate metrics, and consistent service delivery.
